Practical Problems for ML course fall2023

# Linear Regression
predicted insurance prices based on sex, age, IsSmoker, BMI, number of children
using linear regression from scratch and the sk learn linear regression model.

# Sentiment Analysis
sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes from scrath, sklearn Naive Bayes, LSTM, Bert and DistilBert from hugging face.

the task is to predict feeling of a sentence. the classes are joy, fear and anger.

The acc for sklearn ws around 90% and for my model was around 89%.

for the bonus point, in the first noteboook I implemented LSTM and reached to ***96%*** accuracy.

In the second noteboook I fine tuned the Bert and DistilBert Models from hugging face and reached to ***96%*** accuracy with around 600 hundred less data. (to be exact, I used Bert for a competition and the dataset samples for the computation was different)


# Covid19 Sentiment 
predicting sentiment of twitts during covid19 using BERT, lstm and SVM models.
BERT reached 89% acc.

# Logistic Regression
predicting chance of winning or losing in a video game given the game play data. (like kills or potion used or ...)

......
# Project
It's about sentiment on snappfood and digikala comments. the task is to train a neural net on the snappfood data set using a lot of data. then we should fine tune it on a tiny dataset which is digikala commnets. (Snappfood is iranian door dash and digikala is iranian version of Amazon)
